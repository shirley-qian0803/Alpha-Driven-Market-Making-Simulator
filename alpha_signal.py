    Generate a simple momentum signal based on price difference over a lookback window.

    Parameters
    ----------
    price_series : pd.Series
        Series of mid prices.
    lookback : int
        Number of time steps to look back for momentum calculation.

    Returns
    -------
    pd.Series
        Signal values between -1 and 1 representing directional momentum:
        - Positive values suggest upward momentum
        - Negative values suggest downward momentum
